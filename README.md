# Radar-Moving-Target-Classification-Via-CNN
Radar-based classification of ground moving targetsrelies  on  Doppler  information.  Therefore,  the  classification  be-tween  humans  and  animals  is  a  challenging  task  due  to  theirsimilar Doppler signatures. This work proposes a Deep Learning-based  approach  for  ground  moving  radar  targets  classification.The proposed algorithm learns the radar targetsâ€™ micro-Dopplersignatures in the 2D fast-time slow-time domain of radar echoes.This  work  shows  that  the  convolutional  neural  network  (CNN)can  achieve  high  classification  performance.  Also,  it  shows  thatefficient  data  augmentation  and  regularization  significantly  im-prove  classification  performance  and  reduce  over-fit.
